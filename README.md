# BeCode Coaches Onboarding Passport

Welcome to BeCode, where active learning is at the core of our methodology. That’s why our onboarding process is a series of actions, or rather challenges, *YOU*, our new colleague, will take. Some of these challenges are fun, others are good practices that will spark your imagination on how to be the best coach you can be, and a lovely colleague to hang out with. 

## How does this work ?
The Passport is basically a (long) list of challenges organized in Levels. Each challenge describes the required action and the Proof that the challenge has been met, allowing us to validate your challenge. You can do the challenges in any order of priority and whenever you find appropriate. Some are more urgent than others, of course… In this sense, the onboarding never stops : there are always new challenges, including those your undertake under your own initiative.

Meeting these challenges will make you grow into your position. As such, you will be granted Open Badges related to your coaching level, provided you can show the proofs. Since many proofs are rather ephemerous, please archive a copy of all proofs to a repository called `My BeCode Passport`on your personal GitHub account, including all link, image and video assets. 

## Ready ?

- Fork this repository and call it `My BeCode Passport`
- Rename the `my-passport.md` file to `firstname-lastname-passport.md`
- Update, commit and push that file any time you finish a challenge (not forgetting the Evidence assets / proofs)
- Update your fork regularly (here is [a good tutorial](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20984802/how-can-i-keep-my-fork-in-sync-without-adding-a-separate-remote/21131381#21131381) on how to update a forked repository to the base repository)
