# BeCode Coaches Onboarding Passport

Welcome to BeCode, where active learning is at the core of our methodology. That’s why our onboarding process is a series of actions YOU, our new colleague, will take. Some of them are fun, others are good practices that will spark your imagination on how to be the best coach you can be, and a lovely colleague to hang out with. 

## 0. How does this work ?
The Passport is basically a (long) list of challenges. Each describes the challenge and the Proof that the challenge has been met, allowing us to validate your challenge. You can do the challenges in any order of priority and whenever you find appropriate. Some are more urgent than others, of course… In this sense, the onboarding never stops : they are always new challenges.
Meeting these challenges will make you grow into your position. As such, you will be granted Open Badges related to your coaching level, provided you can show the proofs. Since many proofs are rather ephemerous, please archive a copy of all proofs to a folder “My Passport” on your personal BeCode Google Drive, folder that you make sure it is “shared with” all@becode.org
